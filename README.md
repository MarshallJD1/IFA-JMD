The idea:

This website has been created with the sole purpose of helping spread awareness of mental health conditions and to guide those who 
may need a litle help.

The website has been planned to include these elements (Must Haves) :

Solid and clear navigation links always shown at the top of the page
About us section with a brief explination of KeepinMinds mission objective.
A break down of the most common mental health conditions and where to get more information.
An urgent help button that links to the Helpline section. Clear Call to actions to helplines.
Tips and tricks on self care.
Events schedule and meet up times/.
Gallery of warming pictures.
Breathing excercises section that goes through box breathing and other techniques for self therapy.

If there is time these may also be added (Could and should haves) :

Section with images has calming audio to go along side it that is optional to listen to.
Affirmations section - instructing the user to to type out affirmations and commit them,
Annonymous message box so visitor can vent away their woes - is deleted on submission and left with affirmations page for confirmation.
Articles and blog posts to uplift the spirits.

Tested using the validators listed above and lighthouse. 

Bugs :

Media queries need sorting below 550px as hamburger menu overlaps with Help button. (navbar)
Styling errors on 1 heading and the footers , shouldn't be that color.
a few styling bugs sizing wise ; need to resize courasel/cards
when signup complete 'x' doesn't close tab - have to click out.
slight overflow from somewhere on tablet and below cauing horizontal scroll






Reflection : 


Given the timescale and how long I have been coding for, i think this was a good attempt. 

My site is responsive, but the styling could do with a little more attention.
I have created a functional site , with all the required elements - but with much room for improvement.
Looking back i would probably spend a little more time planning the wireframes and how i was going to fully set out 
each page. Would have saved alot of time and back and forth.
